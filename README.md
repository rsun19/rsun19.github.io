# Notes:

I have recently migrated the codebase to TypeScript. You will see a TypeScript and JavaScript folder, but only the TypeScript folder is up to date!

# Website:

# Getting Started with running locally

1. Install Node.js

2. In the the terminal (can access with VS Code terminal), run this command:

- `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`

3. run `npm install`

4. run `npm start`

5. In subsequent steps, steps 2 (if want to edit css), 3, and 4 are mandatory.

6. Happy coding!

7. If you want to deploy onto Github Pages, you will have to do something with `npm run deploy`
